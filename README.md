This is a simple card that has buttons that do something that changes the value on screen and shake another thing and it's pointless but I did it to test and practice how to pass props from parent to buttons as well as an image element. I could have used just the handleButtonClick handler to also make the image shake, but I wanted to test and practice use of useEffect as well. Enjoy!
